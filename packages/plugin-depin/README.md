### Configuration

#### Contract Deployment

- **Deploy the PredictionMarket contract** on your desired network. You can find the contract in /contracts/PredictionMarket.sol. Disclaimer: This contract is not audited and should be used at your own risk. The owner of the contract should be the agent.
- **Set the contract address** in your .env file.
- **Set the token address** in your .env file.
- **Set the network** in your .env file.
- **Set the max ongoing predictions** in your .env file.
- **Update prediction abi** in /src/contracts/predictionAbi.ts if the contract has been modified.

### Actions

#### List Predictions

Lists all active predictions from the database

#### Prepare Bet

The PREPARE_BET action (also known as APPROVE_BET) handles the first step of the betting process by:

1. **Token Approval**: Generates the necessary transaction data for users to approve the ERC20 token contract to spend tokens on their behalf
2. **Bet Validation**: Validates and processes bet parameters including:
    - Prediction ID: The unique identifier of the prediction being bet on
    - Amount: How many $SENTAI tokens to bet
    - Outcome: The predicted outcome (true/false)
    - Bettor Address: The user's wallet address

**Usage Example:**

```
"PREPARE A BET FOR PREDICTION 1, 100 $SENTAI, true, 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e"
```

The action will respond with:

- A unique Bet ID
- Transaction data for token approval
- Instructions for confirming the approval

**Note:** This is a two-step process:

1. First approve the token spending (this action)
2. Then place the actual bet using the PLACE_BET action after approval

#### Place Bet

The PLACE_BET action executes the second and final step of the betting process after token approval is confirmed. It:

1. **Validates the Approval**: Verifies the provided transaction hash of the token approval
2. **Executes the Bet**: Places the bet on-chain with the previously approved parameters:
    - Prediction ID
    - Bet amount in $SENTAI
    - Chosen outcome (Yes/No)
    - Bettor's wallet address

**Usage Example:**

```
"BET 123 APPROVED: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
```

The action will:

- Confirm the approval transaction
- Execute the bet on-chain
- Return a confirmation with:
    - Prediction statement
    - Your bet choice (Yes/No)
    - Bet amount
    - Bettor address
    - Transaction hash

**Note:** This action should only be used after successfully completing the PREPARE_BET step and receiving confirmation of the token approval transaction.

### Evaluators

#### Prediction Evaluator

The Prediction Evaluator is an automated system that analyzes conversations to identify and create new weather-related predictions. It:

- **Monitors Conversations**: Continuously scans discussions for predictive statements about weather
- **Mints Predictions**: Automatically creates predictions on-chain
- **Manages Prediction Lifecycle**:
    - Validates prediction statements
    - Sets appropriate deadlines
    - Tracks prediction status
    - Limits the number of active predictions

### Services

#### Prediction Resolver

The Prediction Resolver is an automated service that validates and resolves weather-related predictions using real-world data. It:

- **Monitors Active Predictions**: Checks for predictions ready to be resolved every minute
- **Validates Outcomes**:
    - Fetches current weather data via QUICKSILVER
    - Compares prediction statements against actual conditions
    - Determines true/false outcomes automatically
- **Resolves On-Chain**:
    - Updates prediction status in the blockchain
    - Triggers reward distribution to winning bettors
    - Updates prediction status in the database
