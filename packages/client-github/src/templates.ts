    Extract the details for configuring the GitHub repository:
    - **owner** (string): The owner of the GitHub repository (e.g., "octocat")
    - **repo** (string): The name of the GitHub repository (e.g., "hello-world")
    - **branch** (string): The branch of the GitHub repository (e.g., "main")

    Provide the repository details in the following JSON format:

    \`\`\`json
    {
        "owner": "<owner>",
        "repo": "<repo>",
        "branch": "<branch>"
    }

    Determine the appropriate action based on the following criteria:
    1. CREATE_ISSUE:
        - When a new bug, feature request, or task is identified that is not already tracked.

            - The issue is not a duplicate of an existing issue. You can find the existing issues under the section "Previous Github Issues".
            - The problem described in the issue is not already being worked on by another issue. You can find the existing issues under the section "Previous Github Issues".
            - Make sure the issue title is not a duplicate of an existing issue. You can find the existing issues under the section "Previous Github Issues".
            - The issue has a significant impact on the project.
            - The issue can be clearly described with specific details and examples.
    2. CREATE_PULL_REQUEST:
        - When code changes are ready to be proposed and reviewed.
        - Criteria:
            - The changes implement a solution to an existing issue or requirement
            - The pull request is not a duplicate of an existing pull request. You can find the existing pull requests under the section "Previous Github Pull Requests".
            - The code changes are complete enough for review
            - The changes follow project coding standards and best practices
            - The pull request includes tests and documentation where appropriate
    3. COMMENT_ON_PULL_REQUEST:
        - When feedback or suggestions are needed for an open pull request.
        - Criteria:
            - The comment addresses specific lines of code or overall implementation.
            - The comment is constructive and helps improve the pull request.
    4. COMMENT_ON_ISSUE:
        - When additional information or clarification is needed for an existing issue.
        - Criteria:
            - The comment provides valuable insights or updates.
            - The comment helps in progressing the resolution of the issue.
    5. REACT_TO_ISSUE:
        - When you want to express agreement or support for an issue.

            - The reaction is appropriate and reflects the sentiment of the pull request.
    7. REPLY_TO_PR_COMMENT:
        - When you want to reply to a comment on a pull request.
        - Criteria:
            - The reply is appropriate and reflects the sentiment of the comment.
    8. IMPLEMENT_FEATURE:
        - When you want to implement a feature in the repository.
        - Criteria:
            - The feature is appropriate and reflects the sentiment of the pull request.
    9. CLOSE_ISSUE:
        - When an issue has been resolved or is no longer relevant.
        - Criteria:
            - The issue has been fixed, and the solution has been verified.
            - The issue is a duplicate or no longer applicable.
    10. CLOSE_PULL_REQUEST:
        - When a pull request is no longer needed or has been superseded.
        - Criteria:
            - The pull request has been merged or is no longer relevant.
            - The pull request does not meet the project's standards or requirements.

            - The pull request is ready to be merged into the target branch.
    12. NOTHING:
        - This action should ONLY be chosen as an absolute last resort, after exhaustively evaluating all other possible actions.
        - Criteria:
            - Every other action (CREATE_ISSUE, COMMENT_ON_ISSUE, etc.) has been carefully considered and definitively ruled out.
            - The repository is in an optimal state with no pending work items requiring attention.
            - All open issues and pull requests have recent activity and don't need intervention.
            - No code improvements, bugs, or potential enhancements can be identified.
            - No ongoing discussions would benefit from additional feedback or reactions.
            - WARNING: This action indicates a complete lack of needed work. Be extremely certain no other actions are appropriate before selecting it.

    If you are not sure about the action to take, please select the "NOTHING" action.
