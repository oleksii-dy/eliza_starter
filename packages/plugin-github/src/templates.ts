    `Examples of bug reports:

1. Logging system not capturing error stack traces:

\`\`\`
**Describe the bug**

The logging system is not properly capturing and formatting error stack traces when errors occur in the application.

**To Reproduce**

1. Add error logging to your application:
\`\`\`javascript
logger.error('An error occurred', error);
\`\`\`

2. Run the application and trigger an error condition

3. Check the logs and notice that the stack trace is either missing or malformed

4. The error details are limited to just the error message without the full stack trace context

**Expected behavior**

I expect the logging system to:
- Capture the complete error stack trace
- Format it in a readable way with proper indentation
- Include the file name and line number for each stack frame
- Preserve the error cause chain for nested errors

**Screenshots**

None

**Additional context**

This makes debugging production issues much more difficult since we can't trace the exact origin and path of errors through the codebase.
\`\`\`

2. Missing debug logs for authentication flow:

\`\`\`
**Describe the bug**

Unable to debug authentication failures due to insufficient logging in the auth flow.

**To Reproduce**

1. Start the application with default logging level
2. Attempt to authenticate with invalid credentials
3. Check logs for debugging information

**Expected behavior**

The logs should contain detailed information about:
- Authentication request parameters (excluding sensitive data)
- Each step of the auth flow
- Specific failure points and error codes
- Token validation results

**Additional context**

Current logs only show success/failure without intermediate steps, making it difficult to diagnose issues.
\`\`\`

3. Event tracking logs missing critical metadata:

\`\`\`
**Describe the bug**

Event tracking logs are missing important metadata needed for analytics and debugging.

**To Reproduce**

1. Trigger a user action (e.g. button click)
2. Check the event logs in monitoring system
3. Notice missing context like user session, feature flags, etc.

**Expected behavior**

Each event log should include:
- Timestamp with timezone
- User session ID
- Feature flag states
- Device/browser info
- Action context
- Related entity IDs

**Additional context**

This makes it difficult to:
- Track user journeys
- Debug edge cases
- Analyze feature usage
- Correlate events
\`\`\`

Examples of feature requests:

1. Add structured logging framework:

\`\`\`
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Debugging production issues is difficult due to inconsistent log formats and missing context.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Implement a structured logging framework that:
- Uses JSON format for all logs
- Includes standard fields (timestamp, severity, correlation ID)
- Supports context injection
- Has different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Allows adding custom fields
- Provides performance logging utilities

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

- Using plain text logs with grep
- Manual JSON formatting
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools only

**Additional context**

This would help with:
- Faster debugging
- Better monitoring
- Easier log aggregation
- Consistent logging patterns
\`\`\`

2. Add distributed tracing capability:

\`\`\`
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Cannot effectively trace requests across multiple services and identify performance bottlenecks.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Implement distributed tracing that:
- Generates unique trace IDs
- Tracks request flow across services
- Measures timing of operations
- Shows service dependencies
- Integrates with existing logging
- Supports sampling for high-traffic systems

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

- Logging correlation IDs only
- Service-level metrics without tracing
- Manual request tracking

**Additional context**

Would integrate with observability stack and help with:
- Performance optimization
- Dependency analysis
- Error correlation
- System understanding
