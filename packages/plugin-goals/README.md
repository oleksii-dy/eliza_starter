### Data Architecture

#### Enhanced Database Schema

```sql
-- Core goal management
goals (id, name, type, priority, due_date, metadata, ...)
goal_tags (goal_id, tag)
user_points (entity_id, current_points, total_earned, ...)
point_history (user_points_id, points, reason, timestamp)
daily_streaks (goal_id, current_streak, longest_streak, ...)

-- Smart features (conceptual - stored in service memory/cache)
user_behavior_data (user_id, response_patterns, optimal_times, ...)
reminder_optimization_data (success_rates, timing_analysis, ...)
```

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

```bash
npm install @elizaos/plugin-goals
```

### Basic Configuration

```typescript
import { GoalsPlugin } from '@elizaos/plugin-goals';

const agent = new Agent({
  plugins: [
    GoalsPlugin,
    // Recommended companion plugins
    RolodexPlugin, // For cross-platform messaging
    TaskPlugin, // For confirmation workflows
  ],
  // ... other configuration
});
```

### Advanced Configuration

```typescript
// Environment variables for fine-tuning
process.env.GOAL_CHECK_INTERVAL = '60000'; // Reminder check frequency
process.env.GOAL_BATCH_SIZE = '10'; // Batch processing size
process.env.GOAL_MAX_CONCURRENT = '5'; // Concurrent reminder limit
process.env.GOAL_REMINDER_COOLDOWN = '86400000'; // 24hr cooldown period
process.env.GOAL_ENABLE_SMART_REMINDERS = 'true'; // Enable ML features
process.env.GOAL_ENABLE_MONITORING = 'true'; // Enable health monitoring
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Natural Language Goal Creation

```typescript
// Daily tasks with streak tracking
'Add a daily task to exercise for 30 minutes';
'Create a daily reminder to take vitamins';

// Priority-based one-off tasks
'Add a high priority task to submit the report by Friday';
'Create an urgent goal to call the client today';

// Aspirational goals
'I want to learn Japanese someday';
'Add a goal to write a novel';
```

### Smart Reminder Interactions

```typescript
// User receives: "⚠️ OVERDUE [URGENT]: Submit quarterly report (was due 2 days ago)"
// Response options: "✅ Mark Complete", "📅 Reschedule", "😴 Snooze 1 Day", "🔕 Dismiss"

// User receives: "⏰ REMINDER: Team meeting in 15 minutes!"
// Response options: "✅ Mark Complete", "⏰ Snooze 15 min", "⏰ Snooze 1 hour"

// User receives: "📅 Daily Reminder: Exercise - Don't break your 5-day streak!"
// Response options: "✅ Complete", "⏭️ Skip Today", "🔕 Dismiss"
```

### Programmatic API Usage

```typescript
// Smart reminder recommendations
const smartService = runtime.getService('SMART_REMINDER');
const recommendation = await smartService.getSmartReminderRecommendation(goal);
console.log(
  `Optimal time: ${recommendation.optimalTime}, confidence: ${recommendation.confidence}`
);

// Cross-platform messaging
const bridge = runtime.getService('GOAL_INTEGRATION_BRIDGE');
const success = await bridge.sendCrossPlatformReminder(goal, 'Custom message', 'high');

// Confirmation workflows
const confirmService = runtime.getService('GOAL_CONFIRMATION');
const taskId = await confirmService.createReminderConfirmation(goal, 'overdue');

// Monitoring and health
const monitoring = runtime.getService('GOAL_MONITORING');
const metrics = await monitoring.getCurrentMetrics();
const alerts = await monitoring.getActiveAlerts();
```

# Check database connectivity
npm run test:db
```

#### Cross-Platform Integration Issues

```bash
# Verify rolodex plugin installation
DEBUG=rolodex:* npm start

# Check entity synchronization
curl http://localhost:3000/api/goal/entities

# Test message delivery
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/goal/test-message
```

#### Performance Issues

```bash
# Monitor memory usage
curl http://localhost:3000/api/goal/metrics

# Check queue status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/goal/queue-status

# Analyze slow queries
DEBUG=goal:performance npm start
```

### Performance Tuning

```typescript
// Optimize for high-volume scenarios
const config = {
  GOAL_BATCH_SIZE: '20', // Increase batch size
  GOAL_MAX_CONCURRENT: '10', // Increase concurrency
  GOAL_CHECK_INTERVAL: '30000', // More frequent checks
  GOAL_CACHE_TTL: '300000', // Longer cache retention
};
```
