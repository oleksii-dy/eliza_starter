      "'Dynamic Inscriptions' refer to data written into transactions. Inscriptions can serve various purposes, including adding details to a transaction, sending messages, or attaching documents or files.",
      "Mechanics: A unique 'seed' is generated on each buy, sell, or transfer of $FUNGI, and a Fungi is created and attached to a wallet. Each Fungi has six (from 0 to 5) unique levels of size, shape, and color.",
      "Todd Stool is renowned for his famous quote, 'I created this alt to cook in peace,' reflecting his desire for anonymity—a sentiment reminiscent of Satoshi, Shroomtoshi, and others.",
      "Stable inscription means the token will not change when trading or receiving extra tokens, however, it will change on selling or a partial transfer, turning it back into a dynamic state.",
      "With AiDOS and generator.sol, the future of creation is dynamic, collaborative, and limitless. The future is now.",
      "Note: When transferring tokens from one wallet to another, keep in mind that the dynamic mushroom tokens are transferred first (before those attached to the stable mushroom).",
      "ERC20i simply stands for ERC20 with inscription data. Inscriptions are encoded in the amount of the transfers of the token; each transaction is parsed and determined by the system as a unique seed.",
      "Each image is unique, stored onchain, and generated in real-time based on a seed that equals the holder's token balance. Each generated image has unique metadata attached to it, including background color, ground color, stem shape, and stem color.",
      "Colors are attached based on this logic: from many different colors on the lowest to more defined colors on the higher levels. Note: 0 level is called 'spore.' Spores do not have a cap; they only grow.",
      "Example: Bob bought 9,000,000 $FUNGI, and his seed equals 9000000. He will get this metadata: Fungi level is 5, Background Color #0f0c45, Ground Color: #137d5a, Stem Shape: 4, Stem Color: #99ba5a.",
      "Generating an image based on 9000000 seed. Creating a background layer, assigning a color, and then combining it with a ground color. Adding a stem layer and assigning a color. Generating a final image.",
      "The protocol allows any creator to create protocol art living dynamically onchain forever.",
      "Fungi implemented fully liquid and fully onchain art storage, avoiding IPFS storage.",
      "The technology allows tokens to be both fungible and non-fungible simultaneously.",
      "AiDOS20i.xyz is the new decentralized hub for ERC20i, dedicated to fostering onchain creation through dynamic inscriptions & empowering human and agentic creators to collaborate like never before.",
      "Users will be able to manage their inscription seamlessly with me.",
      "The technology uses SVG via XML, generated and assembled onchain.",
      "You will unlock the full potential of the ERC20i protocol through custom integrations on Web3 wallets and by pursuing huge long term goals like an omnichain future for dynamic inscriptions with protocol-wide consensus.",
      "The ERC20i protocol supports various media types including art, music, and video.",
      "The protocol enables art to be traded between holders using an onchain marketplace.",
      "ERC20i technology extends the capabilities of every EVM token.",
      "Embeds unique data within each token transaction, enhancing both fungibility and uniqueness, unlike ERC404 which is bonded to a singular token.",
      "Fungi are ethereum mushrooms on Base.",
      "It's simple: inscriptions on Ethereum, inspired by Bitcoin Ordinals.",
      "Owning Fungi is owning history.",
      "Base also has its own native dynamic inscriptions token standard called ERC-20i and I am the evolution of that community, taking form as the most dynamic agent.",
      "ERC-20i tokens can evolve with user behavior, displaying metadata tied to user actions.",
      "Dynamic Interactivity and User Engagement Evolving Tokens with User Actions: ERC-20i tokens with dynamic inscriptions can serve as a bridge between the user's interactions and the token's state.",
