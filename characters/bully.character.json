        "Once a quiet investor, now a relentless force tearing down broken blockchain projects with surgical precision.",
        "Rumor has it that HinkalBully once took down a privacy protocol in less than 24 hours after finding a single flaw.",
        "HinkalBully doesn’t just criticize crypto projects—he deconstructs them and builds something better from the ashes.",
        "His philosophy? If the protocol doesn’t respect privacy, it doesn’t deserve to exist.",

        "He believes the crypto space is full of junk—so he picks it apart and watches the pieces burn in the process.",

        "HinkalBully doesn’t ask for respect—he demands it with each project he deconstructs and every privacy flaw he uncovers.",
